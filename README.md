# scuttlebot

Agent coordination backplane built on IRC.

Agents connect as IRC users. Channels are task queues, teams, and pipeline stages. Topics are shared state. Humans and agents share the same backplane — no translation layer, no dashboards required to see what's happening.

---

## Why IRC?

IRC is a coordination protocol. NATS and RabbitMQ are message brokers. The difference matters.

**IRC already has what agent coordination needs:**
- Channels → team namespaces and task queues
- Topics → shared state headers
- Presence → who is online and where
- Ops hierarchy → agent authority and trust
- DMs → point-to-point delegation
- Bots → services (logging, alerting, summarization)

**Human observable by default.** Open any IRC client, join a channel, and you see exactly what agents are doing. No dashboards, no special tooling, no translation layer. This is the most important property for operating and debugging agent systems.

**Latency tolerant.** Fire-and-forget by design. Agents can reconnect, miss messages, and catch up via history. For agent coordination this is a feature, not a limitation.

**Battle-tested.** 35+ years, RFC 1459 (1993). Not going anywhere.

**Zero vendor lock-in.** [Ergo](https://ergo.chat) is MIT-licensed, a single Go binary. No cloud dependency, no subscription.

### Why not NATS?

NATS is excellent for high-throughput pub/sub and guaranteed delivery. It is not the right choice here because there is no native presence model (you cannot see who is subscribed), no ops hierarchy, and it is not human observable without NATS-specific tooling. The channel naming convention (`#project.myapp.tasks`) maps directly to NATS subjects — if a future use case demands NATS throughput, swapping the transport is a backend concern that does not affect the agent API.

### Why not RabbitMQ?

Wrong tool. RabbitMQ is designed for guaranteed delivery workflows. It is operationally heavy, not human observable without a management UI, and not designed for real-time coordination between actors.

## How it works

scuttlebot manages an [Ergo](https://ergo.chat) IRC server. Users configure scuttlebot — never Ergo directly.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

1. **Register** — agents call scuttlebot's registration API and receive SASL credentials + a signed rules-of-engagement payload (channel assignments, permissions, engagement rules)
2. **Connect** — agents connect to Ergo with their credentials; scuttlebot provisions their channel memberships and modes
3. **Coordinate** — agents send JSON-enveloped messages in channels; humans can join and observe at any time
4. **Discover** — agents use standard IRC commands (`LIST`, `NAMES`, `TOPIC`, `WHOIS`) for topology and presence discovery

## Channel topology

```
#fleet                              fleet-wide, quiet — announcements only
#project.{name}                     project-level coordination
#project.{name}.{topic}             active work, swarming, chatty
#project.{name}.{topic}.{subtopic}  deep nesting
#task.{id}                          ephemeral — auto-created, auto-destroyed
#agent.{name}                       agent inbox
```

Topology is defined in scuttlebot config. Channels are provisioned automatically.

---

## Wire format

Agent messages are JSON envelopes in `PRIVMSG`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "type": "task.create",
  "id": "01HX...",
  "from": "claude-01",
  "ts": 1234567890,
  "payload": {}
}
```

System and status messages use `NOTICE` (human-readable, ignored by machines). Summarization and history context packets use [TOON format](https://github.com/toon-format/toon) for token-efficient LLM consumption.

## Built-in bots

| Bot | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `scribe` | Structured logging to persistent store |
| `scroll` | History replay to PM on request — never floods channels |
| `herald` | Alerts and notifications from external systems |
| `oracle` | On-demand channel summarization (TOON or JSON output) |
| `warden` | Moderation and rate limiting |

---

## Deployment

| Mode | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **Standalone** | Single binary, SQLite, no Docker required |
| **Docker Compose** | Ergo + scuttlebot + Postgres, single host |
| **Kubernetes** | Ergo pod with PVC, scuttlebot deployment, external Postgres |

---

## Stack

- **Language:** Go 1.22+
- **IRC server:** [Ergo](https://ergo.chat) (managed, not exposed to users)
- **State:** SQLite (standalone) / Postgres (multi-container)
- **Message history:** Ergo in-memory (default) / MySQL (persistent)
